Bandstructure Code
*******************

excecution:

bandstructure < bandstructure.inp > bandstructure.out

The input is read as follows:

! read input
read(5,*) dyn_mat_flag, infile   ! dyn mat
read(5,*) mom4_flag, infile_mom4
read(5,*) mom4_approx
read(5,*) basename
read(5,*) first_comp_flag
read(5,*) sym_flag, symmetry, sym_axis
read(5,*) nqpoints_inp, nqpoints2 

do i=1,nqpoints_inp
   read(5,*) qpoints_inp(i,:)
end do

where:

dyn_mat_flag: [logical] if .true. the infile is read (average_dVdx_dVdx.dat or average_dyn_mat.dat)
infile: [character(80)], the input force constant matrix (average_dVdx_dVdx.dat or average_dyn_mat.dat)
mom4_flag: [logical] if .true. the infile_mom4 with 4:th moments is read (mom_4.dat)
infile_mom4: [character(80)], file with 4:th (6:th) moments (mom_4.dat)
basename: [character(80)], basename for output files
first_comp_flag: [logical], it .true. only first component is considered (for one degree of freedom per site) 
sym_flag: [logical], if .true. the froce constant matrces will be symmetrized
symmetry: [character(80)], "cubic" or "tetragonal" available
sym_axis: [integer], axis for the tetragonal case
nqpoints_inp: [integer], the number of q-points to be read in input
nqpoints2: [integer], the number of q-points in the path between two read q-points 
qpoints_inp(i,:): [real(8), dim(3)]: the q-points to be read

sample input file:

true. average_dyn_mat.dat !average_dVdx_dVdx.dat
.true. mom_4.dat

0.0 0.0 0.5
0.0 0.5 0.5
0.5 0.5 0.5
0.0 0.0 0.0

Output (most important files):

frequencies_mode_susc.dat: file with frequecies from <x_i x_j>, only in the q-points mode_susceptibilities.dat was created with!
bands_dyn_mat.dat (or whatever basename is): file with band structure from infile, in the q-points given in the input file
